In computer science, Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) is a universal lossless data compression algorithm. It is based on the Lempel-Ziv (LZ) family of algorithms and is widely used for data compression.

The LZW algorithm builds a dictionary of sequences of input data, replacing repeated occurrences of data with a reference to a single copy of that data existing in the dictionary. The algorithm is particularly effective for data with many repeated patterns, such as graphics files and text.

For example, in the input "ABABABA", the repeated sequences "AB" and "A" can be replaced with references to the dictionary, resulting in a compressed output that uses fewer bits than the original representation.

LZW is used in many applications, including GIF image format and Unix compress command, making it a cornerstone of data compression techniques in software and digital media.
